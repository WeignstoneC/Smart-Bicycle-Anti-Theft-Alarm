A compact smart alarm that protects your bike from theft. It detects motion or tampering, sounds a loud siren and sends alerts to your phone. The device is easy to install, water-resistant and battery-powered for long use.

How It Works:
When armed the sensor detects movement. Minor motion triggers a phone alert. Major tampering activates the siren and notification. The system can be disarmed through the app or button.
